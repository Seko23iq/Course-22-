Working with ArrayList
Objective: Learn how to use ArrayList for storing and manipulating collections of elements.

Overview:

ArrayList provides various methods for adding, removing, and accessing elements.
It's suitable for scenarios where the size of the collection is not known in advance or needs to change dynamically.
Key Points:

Adding Elements: Use the Add() method to add elements to the end of the ArrayList.
Accessing Elements: Elements can be accessed using indexers ([]) or by iterating through the collection.
Removing Elements: Use the Remove() method to remove the first occurrence of a specific element, or RemoveAt() to remove an element at a specific index.
Inserting Elements: Use the Insert() method to insert an element at a specific index.
Sorting and Searching: ArrayList provides methods like Sort() and BinarySearch() for sorting and searching elements, respectively.
Example:

using System;
using System.Collections;


class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        ArrayList list = new ArrayList();
        list.Add(10);
        list.Add(20);
        list.Add(30);


        Console.WriteLine("Elements in ArrayList:");
        foreach (var item in list)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(item);
        }


        list.Remove(20); // Removing an element
        Console.WriteLine("After removing an element:");
        foreach (var item in list)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(item);
        }
       Console.ReadKey();
    }
}


Exercise:

Experiment with different methods of ArrayList, such as Insert(), Sort(), BinarySearch(), etc., to become familiar with their usage and behavior.
These lessons should provide a comprehensive understanding of ArrayList in C# and how to effectively use it in your programs.

Heterogeneous ArrayList Example:

using System;
using System.Collections;


class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        ArrayList list = new ArrayList(); // Creating an ArrayList
        list.Add(10); // Adding elements
        list.Add("Hello");
        list.Add(true);


        Console.WriteLine("Total elements in ArrayList: " + list.Count);


        Console.WriteLine("Content of ArrayList using index:");
        for (int i = 0; i < list.Count; i++)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Index " + i + ": " + list[i]);
        }


        Console.ReadKey();
    }
}

Output:

Total elements in ArrayList: 3
Content of ArrayList using index:
Index 0: 10
Index 1: Hello
Index 2: True

In this example the for loop iterates through each element in the ArrayList using index-based access (list[i]) and prints the index along with the corresponding element. This allows you to see the content of the ArrayList in the order it was added.
