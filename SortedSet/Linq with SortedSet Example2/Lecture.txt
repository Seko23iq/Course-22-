use LINQ with a SortedSet to find elements that satisfy a specific condition and then project those elements into a new form:

using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        SortedSet<int> numbers = new SortedSet<int>() { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 };

        // Find even numbers and project them to their square
        var evenNumbersSquared = numbers.Where(x => x % 2 == 0).Select(x => x * x);
        Console.WriteLine("Squares of even numbers:");
        foreach (var item in evenNumbersSquared)
        {
            Console.Write(item + " ");
        }
        Console.ReadKey();
    }
}
Output:

Squares of even numbers:
4 16 36 64 100

In this example, the Where LINQ method filters the SortedSet to find even numbers, and then the Select method is used to project each even number to its square. This demonstrates how to use LINQ with SortedSet to perform filtering and projection operations efficiently.
