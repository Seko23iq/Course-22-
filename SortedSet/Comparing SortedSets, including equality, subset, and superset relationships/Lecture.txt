 Comparing SortedSets, including equality, subset, and superset relationships
Comparing sets, including equality, subset, and superset relationships, is a common operation in many applications. SortedSet in C# provides methods to perform these comparisons efficiently. Below, I'll demonstrate how to compare sets using SortedSet:

using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;


class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        SortedSet<int> set1 = new SortedSet<int>() { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
        SortedSet<int> set2 = new SortedSet<int>() { 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 };


        // Check if set1 is equal to set2
        bool areEqual = set1.SetEquals(set2);
        Console.WriteLine("Are set1 and set2 equal? " + areEqual);


        // Check if set1 is a subset of set2
        bool isSubset = set1.IsSubsetOf(set2);
        Console.WriteLine("Is set1 a subset of set2? " + isSubset);


        // Check if set1 is a superset of set2
        bool isSuperset = set1.IsSupersetOf(set2);
        Console.WriteLine("Is set1 a superset of set2? " + isSuperset);
        Console.ReadKey();
    }
}


Output:

sql

Copy code
Are set1 and set2 equal? False Is set1 a subset of set2? False Is set1 a superset of set2? False 
In this example:

SetEquals() method checks if two sets contain the same elements. In this case, set1 and set2 are not equal.
IsSubsetOf() method checks if all elements of set1 are in set2. Since set1 contains elements not present in set2, it's not a subset.
IsSupersetOf() method checks if all elements of set2 are in set1. Since set1 doesn't contain all elements of set2, it's not a superset.
You can adjust the elements in set1 and set2 to explore different scenarios of equality, subset, and superset relationships between sets.
