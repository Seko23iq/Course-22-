What is IDictionary?
Definition
IDictionary is an interface located in the System.Collections namespace that represents a collection of key-value pairs. It extends ICollection, facilitating not just the enumeration but also the sophisticated manipulation of data based on keys.

The IDictionary interface is implemented by many classes, including Dictionary<TKey,TValue>, SortedDictionary<TKey,TValue>, and ConcurrentDictionary<TKey,TValue>, each offering different features and performance benefits.

Purpose
The main purpose of IDictionary is to provide a mechanism for accessing items quickly using keys, ensuring efficient data retrieval and storage. It is particularly useful in scenarios where items need to be located and manipulated based on unique identifiers.

IDictionary stands out from other collection interfaces by focusing on key-value pair management. Unlike IEnumerable, ICollection, and IList, which facilitate enumeration and indexed access, IDictionary provides optimized data access through keys, making it ideal for lookup scenarios.

Key Features of IDictionary
IDictionary enhances data manipulation capabilities by introducing features centered around key-value pair management:

Keys and Values Properties: Access collections of keys and values separately.
Item Property: Get or set the value associated with a specific key.
Add, Remove, ContainsKey: Methods to add new key-value pairs, remove pairs, and check if a key exists in the collection.
Conclusion
The IDictionary interface is an essential component of the .NET collection framework, offering a structured approach to managing key-value pairs. Its ability to facilitate quick data access and manipulation based on keys makes it a valuable tool for developers.
