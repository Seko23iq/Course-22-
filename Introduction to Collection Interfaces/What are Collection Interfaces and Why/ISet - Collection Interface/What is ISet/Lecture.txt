What is ISet?
Definition
ISet is an interface located in the System.Collections.Generic namespace, designed to represent a collection of unique elements, ensuring no duplicates are stored.

Purpose
The primary aim of ISet is to facilitate the management of collections where the uniqueness of each element is paramount, providing efficient methods for set operations like union, intersection, and difference.

ISet differentiates itself from other collection interfaces like IEnumerable, ICollection, and IList by focusing on the uniqueness of elements and providing set operations. These capabilities make ISet ideal for scenarios requiring distinct elements with efficient mathematical set processing.

Key Features of ISet
ISet brings forth a set of functionalities tailored for handling unique collections:

Uniqueness: Automatically ensures all elements in the collection are unique.
Set Operations: Supports mathematical set operations, including UnionWith, IntersectWith, ExceptWith, and SymmetricExceptWith, allowing for the combination, comparison, and manipulation of sets.
Add, Remove, Contains: Methods to add new elements (if not already present), remove elements, and check for the existence of elements.
Conclusion
The ISet interface offers a powerful framework for managing collections that require each element to be unique. By providing efficient operations for manipulating sets, ISet enables developers to handle distinct collections effectively in C#.
