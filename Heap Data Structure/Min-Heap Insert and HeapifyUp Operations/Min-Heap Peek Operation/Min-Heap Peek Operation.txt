Min-Heap: Peek Operation
Peek Operation
The Peek operation returns the smallest element in a Min-Heap without removing it. Since the smallest element is always at the root in a Min-Heap, Peek simply returns the root value without deleting it.

Code Example for Peek Operation:
    // Peek the minimum element without removing it
    public int Peek()
    {
        if (heap.Count == 0)
        {
            throw new InvalidOperationException("Heap is empty.");
        }

        return heap[0]; // The smallest element is at the root
    }
