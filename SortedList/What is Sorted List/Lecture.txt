Working with SortedList in C#
In this lesson, we will explore the SortedList collection in C#.

The SortedList is a collection that stores key-value pairs, sorted by the key. It is part of the System.Collections (non-generic) and System.Collections.Generic namespaces in C#.

Understanding how to use SortedList is important for scenarios where you need a dictionary-like collection with sorting by default.

Objectives
Understand the characteristics and use of SortedList in C#.
Learn how to perform basic operations such as adding, removing, and accessing elements in a SortedList.
Explore the differences between the generic and non-generic versions of SortedList.
Characteristics of SortedList
Automatically Sorted: The elements in a SortedList are sorted by the key as soon as they are added.
Key-Value Pairs: Similar to a dictionary, it stores elements as key-value pairs.
Unique Keys: Keys must be unique, and an exception is thrown if a duplicate key is added.
Slower for addition and Faster for Search because it uses binary search algorithm.
Conclusion
SortedList in C# is a useful collection for scenarios where automatic sorting of elements is required. Understanding when to use SortedList over other collections like Dictionary or List is crucial for efficient data management in your applications.
