LINQ with SortedList in C# :
Introduction
This enhanced lesson guides you through utilizing LINQ (Language Integrated Query) with SortedList<TKey, TValue> in C#, including expected results for better understanding. You'll learn to initialize a SortedList, apply LINQ for querying, and filter data based on keys, incorporating both query expression and method syntax.

Prerequisites
Basic C# and .NET collections knowledge.
Familiarity with generic types and LINQ in C#.
Objectives
After this lesson, you'll be able to:

Initialize and populate a SortedList<TKey, TValue> with data.
Apply LINQ queries to a SortedList using both query expression and method syntax.
Perform advanced filtering on a SortedList based on key values.
Lesson Content
Section 1: Introduction to SortedList<TKey, TValue>
Concept: SortedList<TKey, TValue> stores key-value pairs sorted by the key, blending dictionary and array features.
Section 2: Initializing a SortedList
Enhanced Code Example: Populate a SortedList with keys and values, including comments for clarity.
Section 3: Querying SortedList Using LINQ
Query Expression Syntax: Use SQL-like syntax for filtering elements where keys are greater than 1, with comments explaining the process.
Method Syntax: Achieve similar filtering using method syntax, illustrating its flexibility for chaining operations.
Section 4: Advanced Filtering Techniques
Specific Key Value Filtering: Demonstrate how to filter elements with keys greater than a specific value, showcasing LINQ's power for complex queries.
Full Code Example with Comments and Expected Results
Below is the full code example from this lesson, including comments to explain each step and the expected output for better understanding.

using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;


class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // Initialize a SortedList with integer keys and string values
        SortedList<int, string> sortedList = new SortedList<int, string>()
        {
            { 1, "One" },
            { 3, "Three" },
            { 2, "Two" },
            { 4, "Four" } // Enhanced dataset for comprehensive output
        };


        // Query using Query Expression Syntax
        var queryExpressionSyntax = from kvp in sortedList
                                    where kvp.Key > 1 // Filter keys greater than 1
                                    select kvp;
        Console.WriteLine("Query Expression Syntax Results:");
        foreach (var item in queryExpressionSyntax)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"{item.Key}: {item.Value}"); // Expected: 2, 3, 4
        }


        // Query using Method Syntax
        var methodSyntax = sortedList.Where(kvp => kvp.Key > 1); // Filter keys greater than 1
        Console.WriteLine("\nMethod Syntax Results:");
        foreach (var item in methodSyntax)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"{item.Key}: {item.Value}"); // Expected: 2, 3, 4
        }


        // Filter key-value pairs with keys greater than a specific value
        int specificValue = 2;
        var filteredByKey = sortedList.Where(kvp => kvp.Key > specificValue); // Filter keys greater than 2
        Console.WriteLine($"\nEntries with keys greater than {specificValue}:");
        foreach (var item in filteredByKey)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"{item.Key}: {item.Value}"); // Expected: 3, 4
        }
    }
}


Conclusion
Through this enhanced lesson, you now understand how to use LINQ with SortedList<TKey, TValue> in C#, including initializing the list, applying various LINQ queries, and interpreting the expected results. This knowledge enables you to manipulate and query sorted collections efficiently.

Armed with these capabilities, you're well-equipped to handle complex data manipulation and querying tasks in your C# applications, enhancing data processing and analysis functionalities.
