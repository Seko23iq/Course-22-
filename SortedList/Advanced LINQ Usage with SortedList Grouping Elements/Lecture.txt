Advanced LINQ Usage with SortedList: Grouping Elements
Objective
Showcase how to use LINQ to group elements of a SortedList by a specific property of the values. In this case, we will group fruits (string values) by their length.

Updated Code Example Overview
The code example provided demonstrates how to:

Initialize a SortedList with integer keys and string values, where the values represent fruit names.
Use LINQ to group the fruit names by their length.
Display the groups and their corresponding fruit names.
Updated Code Example
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;


class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // Initialize a SortedList of int keys and string values with fruit names
        SortedList<int, string> sortedList = new SortedList<int, string>()
        {
            { 1, "Apple" },
            { 2, "Banana" },
            { 3, "Cherry" },
            { 4, "Date" },
            { 5, "Grape" },
            { 6, "Fig" },
            { 7, "Elderberry" }
        };


        // Grouping fruits by the length of their names
        Console.WriteLine("Grouping fruits by the length of their names:");
        var groups = sortedList.GroupBy(kvp => kvp.Value.Length);
        foreach (var group in groups)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Name Length {group.Key}: {string.Join(", ", group.Select(kvp => kvp.Value))}");
        }
    }
}

Lesson Explanation
Initialization: The SortedList is initialized with integer keys and string values, where each value is a fruit name. The list automatically sorts these fruits based on their integer keys.
Grouping Operation: The LINQ GroupBy method is used to group the fruit names by the length of the name. This showcases how to apply complex querying operations such as grouping on a SortedList, leveraging the GroupBy method to organize data based on a common characteristic.
Displaying Results: The groups are then iterated over, and each group's key (the length of the fruit names) and the corresponding fruit names are printed out. This demonstrates how to access the results of a LINQ grouping operation and present them in a readable format.
Conclusion
This lesson has demonstrated an advanced use case of LINQ with SortedList by focusing on the GroupBy operation to organize data based on a shared attribute. Through this example, we've seen how LINQ can extend the functionality of SortedList, allowing for sophisticated data manipulation and querying techniques such as grouping by the length of string values. This approach can be applied to various data processing scenarios, showcasing the versatility and power of LINQ in handling complex data structures and queries.
