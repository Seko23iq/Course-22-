Advanced LINQ Operations on Arrays - Joining and Projection
Introduction to Joining and Projection
This lesson covers how to use LINQ for joining different data sources and projecting data into a new form.

Concepts
Joining: Combining elements from two arrays based on a common key.
Projection: Transforming elements into a new form.
Example Program: Joining and Projecting Data
using System;
using System.Linq;


class AdvancedLINQJoiningAndProjection
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // Array of employees
        var employees = new[]
        {
            new { Id = 1, Name = "Alice", DepartmentId = 2 },
            new { Id = 2, Name = "Bob", DepartmentId = 1 }
        };


        // Array of departments
        var departments = new[]
        {
            new { Id = 1, Name = "Human Resources" },
            new { Id = 2, Name = "Development" }
        };


        // Joining employees with departments and projecting the result
        var employeeDetails = employees.Join(departments,
                                             e => e.DepartmentId,
                                             d => d.Id,
                                             (e, d) => new { e.Name, Department = d.Name });


        // Displaying the results
        foreach (var detail in employeeDetails)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Employee: {detail.Name}, Department: {detail.Department}");
        }
       Console.ReadKey();
    }
}


Expected Output and Explanation
Employee: Alice, Department: Development
Employee: Bob, Department: Human Resources


Joining: The Join method links employees with their respective departments based on the DepartmentId.
Projection: The result is projected into a new anonymous type containing the employee's name and department name.
Displaying Results: The joined data is displayed, showing each employee and their department.
Conclusion
Joining and projecting are advanced LINQ operations that allow for the combination and transformation of data from different sources. This example illustrates how to relate and reshape data for meaningful insights.
