Introduction to Arrays in C#
Introduction to Arrays
Arrays in C# are used to store a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. They are crucial for storing and managing multiple items in a single variable.

Basic Concepts
Arrays:
An array is a collection of elements, each identified by an index.
C# arrays are zero-based, meaning the index of the first element is 0.
Declaring and Initializing Arrays:
Declaration and initialization can be done in various ways.
Example Program: Declaring and Initializing Arrays
using System;


class ArraysIntroduction
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // Declaring an integer array
        int[] numbers = new int[5];


        // Initializing an array with values
        string[] names = { "Alice", "Bob", "Charlie" };


        // Display the names
        foreach (string name in names)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(name);
        }
       Console.ReadKey();
    }
}
