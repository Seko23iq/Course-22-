Advanced LINQ Operations on Arrays - Filtering and Aggregation
Introduction to Filtering and Aggregation
In this lesson, we'll explore how to use LINQ to perform advanced filtering and aggregation on array data. These operations are key for data analysis and transformation in C#.

Concepts
Filtering: Selecting elements based on a condition.
Aggregation: Summarizing data, such as calculating averages or totals.
Example Program: Filtering and Aggregating Data
using System;
using System.Linq;


class AdvancedLINQFilteringAndAggregation
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // Array of numbers
        int[] numbers = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 };


        // Filtering to get only even numbers
        var evenNumbers = numbers.Where(n => n % 2 == 0);


        // Aggregating - calculating the sum of even numbers
        int sumOfEvenNumbers = evenNumbers.Sum();


        // Displaying the results
        Console.WriteLine("Even Numbers:");
        foreach (var num in evenNumbers)
        {
            Console.Write(num + " ");
        }
        Console.WriteLine($"\nSum of Even Numbers: {sumOfEvenNumbers}");
       Console.ReadKey();
    }
}


Expected Output and Explanation
Even Numbers:
2 4 6 8 10 
Sum of Even Numbers: 30


Filtering: numbers.Where(n => n % 2 == 0) filters the array to include only even numbers.
Aggregation: evenNumbers.Sum() calculates the sum of the filtered even numbers.
Displaying Results: The program first prints all even numbers and then shows their sum.
Conclusion
Filtering and aggregation are powerful tools in LINQ for analyzing and summarizing data. This example demonstrates how to use these techniques to extract specific information from an array and perform calculations.
