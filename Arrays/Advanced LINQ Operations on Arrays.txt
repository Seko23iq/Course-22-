 Advanced LINQ Operations on Arrays
Advanced LINQ Operations on Arrays in C#
Introduction to Advanced LINQ Operations
Advanced LINQ operations in C# enable complex data processing on arrays, such as grouping, sorting, and creating sophisticated queries.

Concepts
Grouping: Organizing elements based on a key.
Ordering: Sorting elements.
Combining Queries: Using multiple LINQ methods together for complex data manipulation.
Example Program: Grouping and Ordering with LINQ
using System;
using System.Linq;


class AdvancedLINQOperations
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // Array of people with Name and Age
        var people = new[]
        {
            new { Name = "Alice", Age = 30 },
            new { Name = "Bob", Age = 25 },
            new { Name = "Charlie", Age = 35 },
            new { Name = "Diana", Age = 30 },
            new { Name = "Ethan", Age = 25 }
        };


        // Grouping people by Age, then ordering within each group
        var groupedByAge = people.GroupBy(p => p.Age)
                                 .Select(group => new
                                 {
                                     Age = group.Key,
                                     People = group.OrderBy(p => p.Name)
                                 });


        // Displaying the results
        foreach (var group in groupedByAge)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Age Group: {group.Age}");
            foreach (var person in group.People)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($" - {person.Name}");
            }
        }

       Console.ReadKey();
    }
}


Expected Output and Explanation
Age Group: 25
 - Bob
 - Ethan
Age Group: 30
 - Alice
 - Diana
Age Group: 35
 - Charlie


Grouping by Age: The people array is grouped by age, creating groups of 25, 30, and 35 years.
Ordering Names Alphabetically: Within each age group, names are sorted alphabetically.
Displaying Results:
The outer foreach loop iterates over each age group.
The inner foreach loop iterates over the people within each age group, displaying their names in alphabetical order.
Conclusion
Advanced LINQ operations such as grouping and ordering provide powerful tools for organizing and querying complex data structures in arrays. This example illustrates how to effectively use these techniques to process and present data in a structured and readable format, making it a valuable skill in C# programming.
