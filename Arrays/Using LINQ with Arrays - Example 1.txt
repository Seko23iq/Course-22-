Using LINQ with Arrays in C#
Introduction to LINQ with Arrays
LINQ (Language Integrated Query) in C# is a powerful tool for querying and manipulating data in arrays. It offers capabilities to perform various operations such as filtering, sorting, aggregating, and transforming array data.

Concepts
LINQ Operations:These operations include filtering, sorting, aggregating, and transforming data in arrays.
Method Syntax and Query Syntax:LINQ can be executed using method calls (method syntax) or a SQL-like query syntax (query syntax).
Example Program: LINQ Operations on Arrays
using System;
using System.Linq;


class LINQWithArraysExample
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // Array of numbers
        int[] numbers = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };


        // Using LINQ to filter and transform data
        var evenSquares = numbers.Where(n => n % 2 == 0).Select(n => n * n);


        // Displaying results
        Console.WriteLine("Squares of even numbers:");
        foreach (var num in evenSquares)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(num);
        }
       Console.ReadKey();
    }
}


Sample Output and Explanation
Squares of even numbers:
4
16


Filtering: The Where clause in numbers.Where(n => n % 2 == 0) filters the array to include only even numbers (2 and 4).
Transformation: The Select clause .Select(n => n * n) then squares these filtered numbers.
Result: The program outputs the squares of the even numbers from the original array, which are 4 (2^2) and 16 (4^2).
Conclusion
LINQ with arrays in C# enables developers to write more expressive and powerful data manipulation code. It makes complex operations such as filtering and transforming data concise and more readable. This example demonstrates the effectiveness of LINQ in performing operations on array data, showcasing its capabilities in simplifying complex data processing tasks.
