Linked List Collection in C#
Objective:
Understand the Linked List data structure and its usage in C#.
Learn how to implement basic operations like insertion, deletion, traversal, and search.
Understand the advantages and disadvantages of linked lists compared to arrays.
Introduction to Linked List:
A linked list is a linear data structure consisting of a sequence of elements where each element points to the next element in the sequence. Unlike arrays, linked lists do not have a fixed size and can dynamically grow or shrink. Linked lists come in different variations such as singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists.

Implementing Linked List in C#:
In C#, you can create your own linked list implementation or use the LinkedList<T> class from the System.Collections.Generic namespace to implement a linked list.

Basic Operations:
Insertion: Insert an element into the linked list.
Deletion: Remove an element from the linked list.
Traversal: Iterate through the elements of the linked list.
Search: Find a specific element in the linked list.
Example Code:
Let's look at a simple example demonstrating the usage of a linked list in C#.

using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        LinkedList<int> linkedList = new LinkedList<int>();


        // Insertion
        linkedList.AddLast(1);
        linkedList.AddLast(2);
        linkedList.AddLast(3);


        // Traversal
        Console.WriteLine("Linked List:");
        foreach (var item in linkedList)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(item);
        }


        // Deletion
        linkedList.Remove(2);


        // Search
        if (linkedList.Contains(3))
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Element 3 found.");
        }
        else
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Element 3 not found.");
        }
       Console.ReadKey();
    }
}


Advantages of Linked Lists:
Dynamic Size: Linked lists can grow or shrink dynamically, unlike arrays, which have a fixed size.
Insertion and Deletion: Insertion and deletion operations can be performed efficiently, especially in the middle of the list.
Memory Utilization: Linked lists utilize memory efficiently by allocating memory only when needed.
Disadvantages of Linked Lists:
Random Access: Unlike arrays, linked lists do not support random access, so accessing elements by index is slower.
Extra Memory Overhead: Linked lists require extra memory to store pointers to the next element, which can increase memory overhead.
Common Use Cases:
Dynamic Data Structures: Linked lists are suitable for implementing dynamic data structures like stacks, queues, and hash tables.
Memory Management: Linked lists are used in memory management systems to manage memory allocation and deallocation.
Conclusion:
Linked lists are a versatile data structure with various applications in computer science and software development. Understanding how to use linked lists efficiently can greatly enhance your problem-solving skills as a programmer. Practice implementing and using linked lists in various scenarios to solidify your understanding.
