Introduction to ObservableCollection<T> in C#
Objective
Gain a foundational understanding of ObservableCollection<T> in C#.

Introduction
ObservableCollection<T>: A dynamic collection in the System.Collections.ObjectModel namespace.
Key Feature: Automatically notifies about any changes made to the collection, like additions, deletions, or refreshes.
Common Use: Widely used in data-binding scenarios, particularly in UI programming with frameworks like WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation).
Key Concepts
ObservableCollection<T> is a generic collection, meaning it can hold any type (denoted by <T>).
It implements INotifyCollectionChanged and INotifyPropertyChanged interfaces, making it ideal for data binding as it provides change notifications to bound UI elements.
Conclusion
Understanding ObservableCollection<T> is crucial for developers working in environments where data changes need to be reflected in real-time in the UI, such as desktop applications with dynamic data displays.
