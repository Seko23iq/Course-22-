Symmetric Difference Operation with HashSet<T> in C#
Objective
Understand retaining elements unique to each set using SymmetricExceptWith.

Full Program Example
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;


class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        HashSet<int> set1 = new HashSet<int> { 1, 2, 3 };
        HashSet<int> set2 = new HashSet<int> { 3, 4, 5 };

        //Retaining elements unique to each set using SymmetricExceptWith.
        // Symmetric difference between set1 and set2
        set1.SymmetricExceptWith(set2);


        Console.WriteLine("Symmetric difference of sets:");
        foreach (int item in set1)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(item);
        }
        Console.ReadKey();
    }
}



Expected Output:

Symmetric difference of sets:
1
2
4
5


Output Explanation: The output represents the symmetric difference, showing elements 1, 2, 4, and 5. These are the elements that are unique to each set, present in either set1 or set2 but not in both.
