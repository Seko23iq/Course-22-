Difference Operation with HashSet<T> in C#
Objective
Learn removing all elements of one set from another using ExceptWith.

Full Program Example
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;


class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        HashSet<int> set1 = new HashSet<int> { 1, 2, 3 };
        HashSet<int> set2 = new HashSet<int> { 3, 4, 5 };


        // Removing elements of set2 from set1
        set1.ExceptWith(set2);


        Console.WriteLine("Difference of sets (set1 - set2):");
        foreach (int item in set1)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(item);
        }
        Console.ReadKey();
  
      }
  }
  
  

Expected Output:

Difference of sets (set1 - set2):
1
2


Output Explanation: The output includes 1 and 2, which are in set1 but not in set2. ExceptWith removes elements from set1 that are also in set2.
