Objective
Learn to combine the elements of two sets using the UnionWith method in HashSet<T>.

Full Program Example
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;


class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        HashSet<int> set1 = new HashSet<int> { 1, 2, 3 };
        HashSet<int> set2 = new HashSet<int> { 3, 4, 5 };


        // Union of set1 and set2
        set1.UnionWith(set2);


        Console.WriteLine("Union of sets:");
        foreach (int item in set1)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(item);
        }
      Console.ReadKey();
    }
}


Expected Output:

Union of sets:
1
2
3
4
5



Output Explanation: The output shows all unique elements from both sets. The number 3, common to both sets, is listed only once, showcasing the unique element property of HashSet.
