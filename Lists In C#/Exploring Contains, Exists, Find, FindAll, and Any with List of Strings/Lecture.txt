Exploring Contains, Exists, Find, FindAll, and Any with List<string> in C#
In this revised lesson, we shift our focus to a List<string> and explore how to use various collection methods like Contains, Exists, Find, FindAll, and Any. These methods are essential for querying and manipulating string collections in C#.

Prerequisites
Basic understanding of C# and collections
Familiarity with List<T> and lambda expressions
Code Setup
We start with a List<string> initialized with various string elements:

List<string> words = new List<string> { "apple", "banana", "cherry", "date", "elderberry", "fig", "grape", "honeydew" };


Exploring Different Methods
1. Contains Method
Checks if the list contains a specific string.

Example:
bool containsApple = words.Contains("apple");
Console.WriteLine("List contains 'apple': " + containsApple);


2. Exists Method
Checks if any string in the list matches a specified condition.

Example:
bool existsLengthFive = words.Exists(word => word.Length == 5);
Console.WriteLine("List contains a word of length 5: " + existsLengthFive);

3. Find Method
Finds the first string that matches a condition. Returns null if no match is found.

Example:
string firstLongWord = words.Find(word => word.Length > 5);
Console.WriteLine("First word longer than 5 characters: " + firstLongWord);


4. FindAll Method
Retrieves all strings that match a specific condition.

Example:
List<string> longWords = words.FindAll(word => word.Length > 5);
Console.WriteLine("Words longer than 5 characters: " + string.Join(", ", longWords));


5. Any Method
Checks if any of the strings in the list satisfy a given condition.

Example:
bool anyStartsWithA = words.Any(word => word.StartsWith("a"));
Console.WriteLine("Any words starting with 'a': " + anyStartsWithA);

Full Example Code
Here's the complete C# console application demonstrating each method:

using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;


class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // List initialization
        List<string> words = new List<string> { "apple", "banana", "cherry", "date", "elderberry", "fig", "grape", "honeydew" };


        // Using Contains
        Console.WriteLine("List contains 'apple': " + words.Contains("apple"));


        // Using Exists
        Console.WriteLine("List contains a word of length 5: " + words.Exists(word => word.Length == 5));


        // Using Find
        Console.WriteLine("First word longer than 5 characters: " + words.Find(word => word.Length > 5));


        // Using FindAll
        Console.WriteLine("Words longer than 5 characters: " + string.Join(", ", words.FindAll(word => word.Length > 5)));


        // Using Any
        Console.WriteLine("Any words starting with 'a': " + words.Any(word => word.StartsWith("a")));


        // Waiting for a key press
        Console.ReadKey();
    }
}


Conclusion
This lesson provided insights into how methods like Contains, Exists, Find, FindAll, and Any can be effectively used with a List<string> in C#. These methods offer powerful ways to query and manipulate string collections, essential for various applications in software development.
