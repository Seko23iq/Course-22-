Aggregating Data Using LINQ with List<int> in C#
In this lesson, we focus on using Language Integrated Query (LINQ) in C# to perform aggregation operations on a List<int>. LINQ is a powerful feature in .NET that provides a convenient and efficient way to query and manipulate data in collections.

We will use the List<int> from the provided code snippet and demonstrate various aggregation operations using LINQ.

Code Setup
First, let's start with the provided list of integers:

List<int> numbers = new List<int> { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 };

LINQ Aggregation Operations
We will explore several aggregation operations: Sum, Average, Min, Max, and Count. Each operation will be demonstrated with a code snippet and explanation.

1. Sum
Calculates the total of all elements in the list.

Example:
int sum = numbers.Sum();
Console.WriteLine("Sum: " + sum);

2. Average
Computes the average value of the elements in the list.

Example:
double average = numbers.Average();
Console.WriteLine("Average: " + average);

3. Min
Finds the smallest element in the list.

Example:
int min = numbers.Min();
Console.WriteLine("Minimum: " + min);


4. Max
Finds the largest element in the list.

Example:
int max = numbers.Max();
Console.WriteLine("Maximum: " + max);

5. Count
Counts the number of elements in the list. This is not strictly an aggregation, but it's a commonly used operation in LINQ.

Example:
int count = numbers.Count();
Console.WriteLine("Count: " + count);


Full Example Code
Here is how the full C# console application might look:

using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;


class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // List initialization
        List<int> numbers = new List<int> { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 };


        // Aggregation operations
        Console.WriteLine("Sum: " + numbers.Sum());
        Console.WriteLine("Average: " + numbers.Average());
        Console.WriteLine("Minimum: " + numbers.Min());
        Console.WriteLine("Maximum: " + numbers.Max());
        Console.WriteLine("Count: " + numbers.Count());


        // Waiting for a key press
        Console.ReadKey();
    }
}

Conclusion
In this lesson, we've seen how LINQ can be used to perform various aggregation operations on a List<int>. These operations are essential for data analysis and can be applied to many real-world scenarios in software development.
