Converting an Array to a List<int> in C#
In this lesson, we'll focus on converting an array to a List<int> in C#. This operation is commonly needed when you're working with APIs that return arrays, or when you need the dynamic features of a list after starting with a fixed-size array.

Prerequisites
Basic understanding of C#, arrays, and collections
Familiarity with List<T> in C#
Code Setup
We begin with an array of integers:

int[] numbersArray = new int[] { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 };

Converting Array to List
Using List<T> Constructor
One of the most straightforward methods to convert an array to a list is using the List<T> constructor that accepts an array.

Example:
List<int> numbersList = new List<int>(numbersArray);

Full Example Code
Here is the complete C# console application for converting an array to a List<int> and displaying its contents:

using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;


class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // Array initialization
        int[] numbersArray = new int[] { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 };


        // Converting the array to a list
        List<int> numbersList = new List<int>(numbersArray);


        // Displaying the list elements
        Console.WriteLine("List elements: " + string.Join(", ", numbersList));


        // Waiting for a key press
        Console.ReadKey();
    }
}

Conclusion
Converting an array to a List<int> in C# is a simple and useful operation, especially when dealing with fixed-size data that needs to be transformed into a more flexible collection. The List<T> constructor provides an efficient way to accomplish this.
