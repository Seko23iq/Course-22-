Understanding List<T> in C#
Introduction
In this lesson, we will explore List<T>, a versatile and widely-used generic collection in C#. We'll understand its features, advantages, and how to use it effectively with practical examples.

What is List<T>?
List<T> is a generic collection class in the .NET framework. It's used to store a collection of objects of the same type (T stands for the type parameter). Unlike arrays, List<T> is dynamic, meaning it can automatically resize as needed.



Key Concepts of List<T>
1. Generic Collection
T in List<T> is a type parameter, meaning that you can create a list of any type (e.g., List<int>, List<string>, or List<YourCustomType>).
2. Dynamic Sizing
Automatically resizes itself, offering more flexibility than traditional arrays.
3. Zero-Based Index
Like arrays, lists use zero-based indexing.
4. Strongly Typed
Ensures type safety. You cannot add an int to a List<string>, for example.


Capacity and Count
Count is the number of elements actually in the List.
Capacity is the number of elements the List can store before resizing.


Thread Safety
List<T> is not thread-safe. For thread-safe collections, consider using ConcurrentBag<T> or other collections from System.Collections.Concurrent.
Conclusion
List<T> in C# is a versatile and powerful collection class, suitable for a wide range of applications. Its dynamic nature, coupled with the powerful features provided by the .NET framework, makes it a go-to choice for storing and manipulating collections of objects.
