Looping Through a List<int> in C#
In this lesson, we will extend our understanding of List<int> in C# by focusing on how to loop through a list. Looping through a list is a fundamental concept that allows you to access and manipulate each element in the collection. We will modify our existing program to include different methods of looping through the List<int>.

Full Code with Looping Examples
Below is code with looping through the list. Each part of the loop is explained with inline comments.

using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;


internal class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Creating and initializing a List of integers
        List<int> numbers = new List<int> { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };


        // Displaying the total number of elements in the list
        Console.WriteLine("Number of items in the list: " + numbers.Count);


        // Looping through the list using a for loop
        Console.WriteLine("\nDisplaying list elements using a for loop:");
        for (int i = 0; i < numbers.Count; i++)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(numbers[i]); // Accessing each element by its index
        }


        // Looping through the list using a foreach loop
        Console.WriteLine("\nDisplaying list elements using a foreach loop:");
        foreach (int number in numbers)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(number); // Accessing each element directly
        }


        // Looping through the list using the List.ForEach method
        Console.WriteLine("\nDisplaying list elements using List.ForEach:");
        numbers.ForEach(number => Console.WriteLine(number)); // Using a lambda expression


        // Waiting for a key press before closing the console window
        Console.ReadKey();
    }
}


Key Concepts Illustrated in the Code
For Loop: Uses a counter to access each element in the list by index. Useful when you need the index of the element.
Foreach Loop: A simpler way to access each element directly. Ideal when you don't need the index.
List.ForEach Method: A method provided by the List class that takes an action (in this case, a lambda expression) and applies it to each element in the list.
Conclusion
Looping through lists is a common operation in C#. This lesson covered three primary methods to iterate over a List<int>: using a for loop, a foreach loop, and the List.ForEach method. Understanding these methods is crucial for performing operations on each element of a list.
