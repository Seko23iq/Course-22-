Stack Collection in C#
Objective:
Understand the Stack data structure and its usage in C#.
Learn how to implement basic operations like push, pop, peek, and clear.
Understand the common scenarios where stacks are useful.
Introduction to Stack:
A stack is a fundamental data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. This means that the last element added to the stack will be the first one to be removed. It resembles a stack of plates where you can only add or remove the top plate.

Implementing Stack in C#:
In C#, you can use the Stack<T> class from the System.Collections.Generic namespace to implement a stack. The type T represents the type of elements in the stack.

Basic Operations:
Push: Adds an item to the top of the stack.
Pop: Removes and returns the item at the top of the stack.
Peek: Returns the item at the top of the stack without removing it.
Clear: Removes all items from the stack.
Example Code:
Let's look at a simple example demonstrating the usage of a stack in C#.

using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;


class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Stack<int> stack = new Stack<int>();


        // Pushing elements onto the stack
        stack.Push(1);
        stack.Push(2);
        stack.Push(3);


        // Peeking at the top element
        Console.WriteLine("Top element: " + stack.Peek());


        // Popping elements from the stack
        Console.WriteLine("Popped: " + stack.Pop());
        Console.WriteLine("Popped: " + stack.Pop());


        // Checking if the stack is empty
        if (stack.Count == 0)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Stack is empty.");
        }
        else
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Top element: " + stack.Peek());
        }

        // Clearing the stack
        stack.Clear();
    }
}


Common Use Cases:
Expression Evaluation: Stacks are used in evaluating expressions, particularly infix to postfix conversion and postfix evaluation.
Backtracking Algorithms: Stacks can be used to keep track of choices made during backtracking algorithms.
Undo Mechanisms: Stacks can facilitate undo operations in applications where users need to revert their actions.
Conclusion:
Stacks are a versatile data structure with various applications in computer science and software development. Understanding how to use stacks efficiently can greatly enhance your problem-solving skills as a programmer. Practice implementing and using stacks in various scenarios to solidify your understanding.
