Using LINQ with HashSet<string> in C#
Objective
Learn to apply LINQ operations on a HashSet<string> for filtering and manipulating string data.

Full Program Example
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;


class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // Creating and populating a HashSet of strings
        HashSet<string> names = new HashSet<string> { "Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "Daisy", "Ethan", "Fiona" };


        // Using LINQ to filter names that start with 'C'
        var namesStartingWithC = names.Where(name => name.StartsWith("C"));


        // Displaying the names starting with 'C'
        Console.WriteLine("Names Starting with C:");
        foreach (var name in namesStartingWithC)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(name);
        }


        // Using LINQ to find names with length greater than 4 characters
        var namesLongerThanFour = names.Where(name => name.Length > 4);


        // Displaying the names longer than four characters
        Console.WriteLine("\nNames Longer Than Four Characters:");
        foreach (var name in namesLongerThanFour)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(name);
        }
Console.ReadKey();
    }
}


Explanation
HashSet of Strings: We create a HashSet<string> containing various names.
LINQ Filtering: We use LINQ's Where method to filter the names.First, we select names that start with the letter 'C'.
Then, we select names that are longer than four characters.
Displaying Results: The results of each LINQ query are displayed using a foreach loop.
Comments
The code is annotated with comments for clarity, detailing each LINQ operation.
This example showcases how LINQ can be effectively used with HashSet<string> for string manipulation and filtering.
Conclusion
This lesson demonstrates the versatility of combining LINQ with HashSet<string> in C#. It shows how easily we can query and manipulate string data stored in a HashSet using LINQ methods.

This practical example illustrates the use of LINQ for handling strings within a HashSet, providing a clear understanding of how to apply these techniques in real-world programming scenarios.
