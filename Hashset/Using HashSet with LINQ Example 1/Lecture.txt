Using HashSet with LINQ in C#
Objective
Learn how to use LINQ with HashSet<T> for advanced data manipulation.

Introduction to LINQ with HashSet
LINQ (Language Integrated Query): A powerful set of tools for querying and manipulating data in C#.
Combining LINQ with HashSet: Enhances the capability of HashSet<T> by providing more complex operations like filtering, searching, and sorting (if applicable).
Full Program Example
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;


class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // Creating and populating a HashSet of integers
        HashSet<int> numbers = new HashSet<int> { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 };


        // Using LINQ to filter out even numbers
        var evenNumbers = numbers.Where(n => n % 2 == 0);


        // Displaying the even numbers
        Console.WriteLine("Even Numbers:");
        foreach (var number in evenNumbers)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(number);
        }


        // Using LINQ to find numbers greater than 5
        var numbersGreaterThanFive = numbers.Where(n => n > 5);


        // Displaying the numbers greater than 5
        Console.WriteLine("\nNumbers Greater Than 5:");
        foreach (var number in numbersGreaterThanFive)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(number);
        }
     Console.ReadKey();

    }
}


Explanation
Creating HashSet: We start by creating a HashSet<int> with integers from 1 to 10.
Filtering with LINQ: We use the Where method from LINQ to filter the HashSet. First, we get all even numbers, then all numbers greater than 5.
Displaying Results: The filtered results are displayed using a foreach loop.
Comments
The code contains detailed comments explaining each step of using LINQ with HashSet<T>.
It's important to note that while HashSet<T> does not maintain order, the LINQ operations will process elements in the order they are stored internally in the HashSet.
Conclusion
This lesson showcases the integration of LINQ with HashSet<T> in C#, demonstrating its potential for more sophisticated data operations. LINQ enhances the usability of HashSet<T>, especially when it comes to querying and filtering data based on specific criteria.

This lesson provides a practical approach to using LINQ with HashSet<T> in C#, enabling learners to understand and apply these concepts in real-world scenarios.
