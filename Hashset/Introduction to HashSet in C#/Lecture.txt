Introduction to HashSet<T> in C#
Objective
Understand what HashSet<T> is and its key characteristics.

Content
Definition: HashSet<T> is a collection class in the System.Collections.Generic namespace designed to store unique elements.
Uniqueness: The primary feature of HashSet<T> is that it automatically ensures all elements are unique.
No Indexing: Unlike lists, HashSet<T> does not maintain the order of its elements and does not support indexing.
Generic: HashSet<T> is a generic collection, meaning it can store any type of object.

Conclusion
HashSet<T> in C# is a powerful collection for storing unique elements. It is particularly useful when you need to ensure no duplicates, perform set operations, and when the order of elements is not a concern.

Remember, HashSet<T> does not support indexing, so if you need to access elements by index, consider using other collections like List<T>.
