Preorder Tree Traversal
Introduction
Preorder tree traversal is one of the primary methods used to explore and interact with tree data structures. It is especially useful in binary trees, where each node has at most two children. This lesson covers the basics of preorder traversal, how it works, and where it can be applied.

Preorder traversal is a method of visiting all the nodes in a tree data structure in a specific order: the current node first (root), then the left subtree, and finally the right subtree.

Introduction to Preorder Traversal
In preorder traversal, each node is processed before its child nodes. The process follows this order:

Visit the root.
Traverse the left subtree in preorder.
Traverse the right subtree in preorder.
This traversal method is particularly useful for creating a copy of the tree or expressing the tree in a way that can later be reconstructed, such as when serializing and deserializing a binary tree.

Consider a binary tree of integer values:

    1
   / \
  2   3
 / \
4   5

Preorder traversal of this tree would visit the nodes in the following order: 1, 2, 4, 5, 3.

Conclusion
Preorder traversal is a fundamental technique for navigating and manipulating tree data structures. Its straightforward approach—visiting the root before the subtrees—makes it a useful tool for a wide range of applications, from tree copying to expression evaluation. Understanding preorder traversal is a key step in mastering tree-based algorithms and data manipulation techniques.
