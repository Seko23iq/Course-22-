Postorder Tree Traversal
Postorder traversal is a technique to visit all the nodes in a tree data structure in a specific sequence: first the left subtree, then the right subtree, and finally the current node (root).


What is Postorder Traversal?
In postorder traversal, a binary tree is traversed in the following order:

Traverse the left subtree in postorder.
Traverse the right subtree in postorder.
Visit the root node.
Postorder traversal is especially useful in scenarios where you need to visit child nodes before their parents, such as when calculating the size or depth of a tree, or when performing certain cleanup or evaluation tasks that require child nodes to be processed first.
