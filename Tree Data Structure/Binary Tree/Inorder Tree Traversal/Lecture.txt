Inorder Tree Traversal
Inorder traversal is one of the fundamental tree traversal techniques, particularly suited for binary trees. It ensures that all nodes are visited in their non-decreasing order when applied to a binary search tree.

What is Inorder Traversal?
Inorder traversal follows a specific sequence to visit all the nodes in a binary tree:

Traverse the left subtree in inorder.
Visit the root node.
Traverse the right subtree in inorder.
This method ensures that nodes are visited in ascending order for binary search trees, making it particularly useful for operations like tree sorting and building sorted lists from trees.
