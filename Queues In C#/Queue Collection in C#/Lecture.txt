Queue Collection in C#
Objective:
Understand the Queue data structure and its usage in C#.
Learn how to implement basic operations like enqueue, dequeue, peek, and clear.
Understand the common scenarios where queues are useful.
Introduction to Queue:
A queue is a fundamental data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. This means that the first element added to the queue will be the first one to be removed. It resembles a line of people waiting for a service where the first person to join the line is the first one to get served.

Implementing Queue in C#:
In C#, you can use the Queue<T> class from the System.Collections.Generic namespace to implement a queue. The type T represents the type of elements in the queue.

Basic Operations:
Enqueue: Adds an item to the end of the queue.
Dequeue: Removes and returns the item at the beginning of the queue.
Peek: Returns the item at the beginning of the queue without removing it.
Clear: Removes all items from the queue.
Example Code:
Let's look at a simple example demonstrating the usage of a queue in C#.

using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;


class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Queue<string> queue = new Queue<string>();


        // Enqueueing elements into the queue
        queue.Enqueue("Alice");
        queue.Enqueue("Bob");
        queue.Enqueue("Charlie");


        // Peeking at the first element
        Console.WriteLine("First in line: " + queue.Peek());


        // Dequeueing elements from the queue
        Console.WriteLine("Served: " + queue.Dequeue());
        Console.WriteLine("Served: " + queue.Dequeue());


        // Checking if the queue is empty
        if (queue.Count == 0)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Queue is empty.");
        }
        else
        {
            Console.WriteLine("First in line: " + queue.Peek());
        }


        // Clearing the queue
        queue.Clear();

     Console.ReadKey();
    }
}


Common Use Cases:
Breadth-First Search (BFS): Queues are widely used in BFS algorithms for traversing graphs level by level.
Task Scheduling: Queues can be used to manage tasks or jobs in a system where the tasks need to be executed in the order they were received.
Resource Sharing: Queues can facilitate resource sharing among multiple processes or threads in a concurrent system.
Conclusion:
Queues are a fundamental data structure with various applications in computer science and software development. Understanding how to use queues efficiently can greatly enhance your problem-solving skills as a programmer. Practice implementing and using queues in various scenarios to solidify your understanding.
