Using Overlaps with HashSet<T> in C#
Objective
Learn to determine if two HashSet<T> instances share any common elements using Overlaps.

Full Program Example
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;


class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        HashSet<int> set1 = new HashSet<int> { 1, 2, 3 };
        HashSet<int> set2 = new HashSet<int> { 3, 4, 5 };
        HashSet<int> set3 = new HashSet<int> { 6, 7, 8 };


        Console.WriteLine("set1 overlaps set2: " + set1.Overlaps(set2));
        Console.WriteLine("set1 overlaps set3: " + set1.Overlaps(set3));
        Console.ReadKey();
    }
}



Expected Output:

set1 overlaps set2: True
set1 overlaps set3: False


Output Explanation: The Overlaps method shows that set1 and set2 share common elements (e.g., 3), while set1 and set3 do not have any common elements.
