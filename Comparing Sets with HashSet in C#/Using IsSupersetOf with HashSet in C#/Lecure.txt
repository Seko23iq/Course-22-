Using IsSupersetOf with HashSet<T> in C#
Objective
Understand how to check if a HashSet<T> is a superset of another collection using IsSupersetOf.

Full Program Example
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;


class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        HashSet<int> set1 = new HashSet<int> { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
        HashSet<int> set2 = new HashSet<int> { 2, 3 };


        Console.WriteLine("set1 is a superset of set2: " + set1.IsSupersetOf(set2));
        Console.ReadKey();
    }
}

Expected Output:

set1 is a superset of set2: True

Output Explanation: set1 is a superset of set2 as it contains all elements of set2 plus additional elements.
