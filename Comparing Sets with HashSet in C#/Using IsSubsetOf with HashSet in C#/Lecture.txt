Using IsSubsetOf with HashSet<T> in C#
Objective
Learn how to determine if a HashSet<T> is a subset of another collection using IsSubsetOf.

Full Program Example
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;




class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        HashSet<int> set1 = new HashSet<int> { 1, 2 };
        HashSet<int> set2 = new HashSet<int> { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };

        Console.WriteLine("set1 is a subset of set2: " + set1.IsSubsetOf(set2));
        Console.WriteLine("set2 is a subset of set1: " + set2.IsSubsetOf(set1));

        Console.ReadKey();


    }
}





Expected Output:

set1 is a subset of set2: True
set2 is a subset of set1: False


Output Explanation: The output demonstrates that set1 is a subset of set2 because all elements of set1 are contained within set2

While the other statement is not.
