Unboxing in C#
Objective
Understand what Unboxing is in C# and how to perform it correctly.

Introduction to Unboxing
Unboxing is the reverse process of Boxing, where the value type is extracted from the object. It's crucial to ensure the type being unboxed matches the type of the object.

Full Program Example
using System;


class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        int valType = 10;
        object objType = valType; // Boxing


        int unboxedValType = (int)objType; // Unboxing


        Console.WriteLine("Unboxed Value: " + unboxedValType);
    }
}



Expected Output
Unboxed Value: 10


Output Explanation
The program demonstrates Unboxing, where the value 10 is retrieved from objType (the boxed object) and stored back in unboxedValType, a value type.

Key Point
Unboxing requires the exact data type match; otherwise, it results in InvalidCastException.

Conclusion
Unboxing is a critical operation in C# that retrieves value types from objects. Proper type matching is essential for successful unboxing.
