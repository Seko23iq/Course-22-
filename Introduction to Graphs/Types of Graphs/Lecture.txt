Types of Graphs
1- Undirected Graph:

Edges have no direction, meaning the relationship is two-way. For example, a friendship in a social network.
Example: If an edge connects vertices A and B, it means you can go from A to B and B to A.
2- Directed Graph (Digraph):

Edges have direction, indicating a one-way relationship. These edges are often represented by arrows.
Example: A one-way road between two locations, or the "follows" relationship in social media.
Degree: The number of edges connected to a vertex. In directed graphs, there are:
In-degree: Number of incoming edges to a vertex.
Out-degree: Number of outgoing edges from a vertex.
3- Weighted Graph:

Each edge has an associated weight or cost.
Example: In a map, the edges represent roads, and the weights represent distances.
4- Unweighted Graph:

All edges have the same weight (often implicitly set to 1).

5- Cyclic and Acyclic Graphs:

Cyclic Graph: Contains at least one cycle (a path that starts and ends at the same vertex).
Acyclic Graph: Contains no cycles. A special type of acyclic graph is a tree.
