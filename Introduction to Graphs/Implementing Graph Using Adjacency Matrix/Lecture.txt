Key Features of the Code:
This C# code implements a graph data structure using an adjacency Matrix. The graph can be directed or undirected, and edges can have weights. Here's a breakdown of the code:

Graph Directionality:
The graph can be either directed or undirected, as specified during the graph creation (GraphDirectionType).
In directed graphs, edges go only one way (from source to destination).
In undirected graphs, edges go both ways (source <-> destination).
Adjacency Matrix Representation:
The graph is represented using a 2D array (_adjacencyMatrix) where the rows and columns correspond to the vertices.
The matrix values represent the weights of the edges between vertices. A weight of 0 means no edge exists.
Vertex Mapping:
The vertices are stored as strings, and a dictionary (_vertexDictionary) maps the vertex names (like "A", "B", etc.) to their corresponding indices in the adjacency matrix.
Edge Addition/Removal:
AddEdge: Adds a weighted edge between two vertices.
RemoveEdge: Removes an edge between two vertices by setting their corresponding matrix entries to 0.
Degree Calculation:
GetInDegree: Calculates how many edges are directed into a vertex (only applicable in directed graphs).
GetOutDegree: Calculates how many edges leave a vertex (outgoing edges).
Graph Display:
DisplayGraph: Displays the adjacency matrix with weights and shows a string-based header for the vertices.
Graph Operations:
The code demonstrates the creation of multiple graph examples (undirected, directed, weighted) and shows how to perform various operations such as adding/removing edges, checking for the existence of an edge, and calculating degrees.
