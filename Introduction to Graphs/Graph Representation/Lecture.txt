Graph Representation
Graphs can be represented in two main ways:

1- Adjacency Matrix:

A 2D array where the element at position [i][j] indicates whether there is an edge between vertex i and vertex j.
For weighted graphs, the value in the matrix cell can represent the weight of the edge.
Example:

For a graph with 4 vertices (A, B, C, D):

    A  B  C  D
A [0, 1, 0, 1]
B [1, 0, 1, 0]
C [0, 1, 0, 1]
D [1, 0, 1, 0]
Pros: Fast lookup to check if an edge exists.
Cons: Space-intensive for large graphs with many vertices but few edges.
2- Adjacency List:

Each vertex has a list of adjacent vertices (vertices it is connected to).
Example:

For a graph with vertices A, B, C, D:

A: B, D
B: A, C
C: B, D
D: A, C
Pros: Space-efficient for sparse graphs (graphs with fewer edges).
Cons: Slightly slower to check if a specific edge exists between two vertices.



Example to Illustrate a Graph
Imagine a network of cities connected by roads:

Cities: A, B, C, and D (Vertices).
Roads: Connections between these cities (Edges).
Some roads may have travel times (Weights).
Representation:

1- Adjacency List:

A: B (5), D (8)
B: A (5), C (3)
C: B (3), D (2)
D: A (8), C (2)
Note: Here, the numbers in parentheses represent the travel time (weights) between cities.

2- Adjacency Matrix:

      A  B  C  D
  A [0, 5, 0, 8]
  B [5, 0, 3, 0]
  C [0, 3, 0, 2]
  D [8, 0, 2, 0]
