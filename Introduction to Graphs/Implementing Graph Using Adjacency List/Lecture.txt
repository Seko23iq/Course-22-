Key Features of the Code:
This C# code implements a graph data structure using an adjacency list. The graph can be directed or undirected, and edges can have weights. Here's a breakdown of the code:

Graph Representation:
The graph is represented by a dictionary (_adjacencyList), where each vertex is associated with a list of tuples. Each tuple represents an edge, containing the destination vertex and the weight of the edge.
The graph type (directed or undirected) is defined by an enum enGraphDirectionType.
Another dictionary (_vertexDictionary) maps vertex labels (strings) to their indices for efficient access.
Constructor:
The constructor initializes the graph based on a list of vertices and the type of the graph (directed or undirected). It sets up the adjacency list and the vertex mapping.
Adding and Removing Edges:
The AddEdge method adds a weighted edge between two vertices. If the graph is undirected, the reverse edge (from destination to source) is also added.
The RemoveEdge method removes an edge between two vertices. For undirected graphs, it removes both the forward and reverse edges.
Graph Operations:
DisplayGraph prints the adjacency list representation of the graph.
IsEdge checks if there is an edge between two vertices.
GetInDegree and GetOutDegree return the in-degree (number of incoming edges) and out-degree (number of outgoing edges) for a vertex.
Main Method:
The Main method creates three different graphs (undirected, directed, and weighted), adds edges, displays the graphs, and performs various operations like calculating in-degree, out-degree, checking edges, and removing edges.
