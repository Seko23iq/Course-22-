Introduction to Graphs
A graph is a data structure that models relationships between different objects. In a graph, objects are represented as nodes (or vertices), and the connections between these objects are called edges (or arcs). Graphs can represent a wide variety of real-world situations, such as social networks, road maps, network routing, and much more.

Basic Terminology
Vertex (Node): A point in the graph where edges meet. Vertices are the fundamental units of the graph.
Edge (Connection): A line connecting two vertices in the graph, indicating a relationship between them. An edge can have an optional weight that represents the cost, distance, or any measure of connection between two nodes.
Adjacency: A vertex is said to be adjacent to another vertex if there is an edge connecting them.
Path: A sequence of edges connecting a series of vertices.
Cycle: A path that starts and ends at the same vertex, with all edges distinct.

Real-World Applications of Graphs
Social Networks: Graphs can represent relationships between people. Users (vertices) are connected if they are friends (edges).
Transportation networks: Graphs can represent roads, railways, and flight routes.
Maps and Navigation: Locations (vertices) are connected by roads (edges) with distances or travel times (weights).
Internet Routing: Routers (vertices) and the connections between them (edges) determine the best path for data to travel.
Recommendation Systems: Items (vertices) connected to users (edges) based on interactions.
Computer networks: Graphs can represent the connections between computers.
